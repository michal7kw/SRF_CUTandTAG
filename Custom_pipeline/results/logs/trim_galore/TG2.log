Using an excessive number of cores has a diminishing return! It is recommended not to exceed 8 cores per trimming process (you asked for 16 cores). Please consider re-specifying
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.9
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
pigz 2.8
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 16 cores

igzip command line interface 2.31.0
igzip detected. Using igzip for decompressing

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /beegfs/scratch/ric.broccoli/kubacki.michal/MIRKO_DATA/Custom_pipeline/results/trimmed/


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> DATA/POL2/TG2_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	887393	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	88.74
Illumina	5	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 887393). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 5)

Writing report to '/beegfs/scratch/ric.broccoli/kubacki.michal/MIRKO_DATA/Custom_pipeline/results/trimmed/TG2_R1_001.fastq.gz_trimming_report.txt'

SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: DATA/POL2/TG2_R1_001.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 4.9
Python version: could not detect
Number of cores used for trimming: 16
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'CTGTCTCTTATA' (Nextera Transposase sequence; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 4.9). Setting -j 16
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to TG2_R1_001_trimmed.fq.gz
